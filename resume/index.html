    <h1>Matt Bradley</h1>
    <h2 class="color--grey">Resume</h2>
    <p>As a web developer I seldom need a resume &mdash; most of my work comes by way of
      referrals or word of mouth. Sometimes, however, they're needed. Here's mine.</p>
  </header>

  <article>

    <section>
      <h3 class="color--avalog">Avalog Design Ltd &mdash; 2015 to present</h3>
      <p>As an independent contractor I spend my time being parachuted into all sorts
      of situations. Some fresh 'Day 1' builds, some deadline-encroaching, hail mary rescue missions
    and everything in-between. By working alongside agencies I've tackled projects for a
  boat-load of clients, namely: <b class="color--starbucks">Starbucks</b>, <b class="color--fitbit">FitBit</b>, <b class="color--wb">Whistler Blackcomb</b>,
<b class="color--grid">The Grid</b>, <b class="color--tesco">Tesco</b>, <b class="color--sasktel">SaskTel</b>, <b class="color--ca">Cricket Australia</b>
to name but a few.</p>

    <p>I specialize in front-end, UI development. Which, on a good day, involves writing clean, performant HTML, CSS and Javascript.
    Given the choice, I keep things as vanilla as possible: HTML for the bare bones, CSS (usually SCSS) for mobile-first UI goodness,
    and Javascript to progressively enhance thereafter.</p>

    <p>I can, and will, work in a plethora of environments depending on what's needed: React, Angular, <em>&lt;insert new JS thing here&gt;</em>, LESS, Bootstrap, Wordpress, Laravel, JAMstack.
    But, that said, you'd be surprised how many sites still run on good ol' jQuery!</p>

    <p>Good contractors have to stay as neutral as possible, like Switzerland!</p>

    <p>A laundry list of client names is all well and good, but my best work comes for the little side projects
    that earn me no money whatsoever. I'd happily talk to you all day about <a href="https://avalog.co">Avalog</a>, my idea to make avalanche
  forecasts more accessible and easier to read.</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 class="color--tw">Tourism Whistler &mdash; 2010 to 2015</h3>
      <p>After fleeing to the mountains of Whistler, BC, Canada I snagged a job
      with Tourism Whistler as a front-end developer. Working in-house on one
    project/site was a welcome change from the fast paced agency lifestyle of endless campaigns and microsites.
    Instead of rushing client projects out the door, we honed and perfected our one product:
  researching, building, watching, tweaking, repeating.</p>

      <p>With the mobile/responsive revolution well under way, all front-end was built with
      a thousand browsers/devices in mind with a nod towards accessibility and as performant
      as possible.</p>

      <p>Having built and rebuilt the site a few times over the years, my last iteration of the site is still
        standing to this day (4 years and counting). The site was built with a
      styleguide-first approach to ensure maximum resuablilty for our components, and made it a great resource for
      the many folk who maintained the site.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 class="color--pink">Coolpink &mdash; 2007 to 2009</h3>
      <p>Coolpink was my first real crack at digital agency life. I loved it. We were a small,
      scrappy team punching well above our weight. We had huge, household name clients
      whilst maintaining that seat-of-your-pants attitude to getting things done.</p>

      <p>I started as a Fullstack developer (back when it was just called 'Web Developer'),
      but soon realized my talents, and interests, lay in front-end developement. Before iPhones and
    responsiveness this meant crafting 'pixel perfect' interfaces for one resolution, usually 1024px.
    It helped give me a solid base in proper, correct use of HTML and CSS.</p>

    <section>
      <h3 class="color--grey">1984 to 2007</h3>
      <p>Life stuff. Just, <em>you know</em>, stuff.</p>
