        See, all portfolios these days follow the same format. Same witty one
        line intro, same smattering of trendy buzz words, same glossy screen
        shots of work, oh and not forgetting the links to social media accounts,
        all 12 of them. <em><b>Fuck that.</b></em>
      </p>

      <p>
        If you were hoping to form an opinion on my ability as a developer by
        skim reading my portfolio and glancing at a few high res, drop shadowed
        screen shots then you are very much mistaken.

        Web design / development is a wide ranging and very broad umbrella term,
        in it you will find many different job titles and skill sets. I'm an
        Interface developer, which roughly means that my skills lie in HTML, CSS
        and JavaScript. Even though my job is to write code, I still see myself
        as somewhat of a writer. And the things I write have to be robust,
        reusable, semantic, efficient and error free. I approach my work in the
        same way I would writing this. I sweat the details; the little things.
        I'd like to tell you I haven't fretted over whether to use "class-name,
        class_name or className" but it genuinely bothers me. Daily. There's
        something strangely rewarding about giving a shit at a granular level.
        You wouldn't have a sentence with erroneous punctuation or grammar, so
        the same should apply to writing code.
      </p>

        I currently work at an
        <a

        >
        whose name you might struggle to pronounce. I'm part of a small team
        working on the <attr title="Product Display Page">PDP</attr> and we
        recently rebuilt the entire thing using a mixture of Next.js,
        serverless, styled components and a lil bit of duct tape. Doing so means
        it's more performant, accessible, easier to maintain and makes it easier
        for customers to spend their money. Go consumerism, go!

        I've completed projects for a

          rel="external"
          >everyone's favourite ski resort</a
        >. Not to mention countless smaller, less glamorous projects. Projects
        that don't really stand out on a list but ones that probably hold more
        weight in terms of experience gained and lessons learned.
      </p>

      <p>
        That doesn't take into consideration the countless other personal
        projects I manage to <s>waste</s> <i>fill</i> my time with. Some so
        small and meaningless they barely ever make it online, others actually
        end up as useful and, dare I say it, <i>good</i>. I tend to lean towards
        side projects that have a real world purpose instead of just the usual
        open source "tools for developers, by developers". Sure, most employers
        are impressed with active open source contribution, but I find it
        difficult spending my spare time on something that is little more than
        dick measuring and seeing who can pee furthest up a wall.

        Or <a href="https://avalog.co" title="avalog.co">avalog.co</a>, which is
        a very early stage prototype for skiers to share their safety reports
        and avalanche sightings. A collaboration with a friend, this aims to be
        a source of knowledge and information for novice skiers heading out in
        to dangerous terrain, and will hopefully coax people into pre planning
        any potentially dangerous trips.

        <a href="https://www.bcbuses.com" title="www.bcbuses.com">bcbuses.com</a
        >, for example. This was borne out of living in an area where the bus
        company had a shockingly bad website, to the extent that checking for
        the next bus was a pain. Initially made for myself and house mates to
        replace the paper schedule pinned to the fridge door, it is now a fully
        responsive, mobile friendly site that is widely used throughout the
        community.

        Congratulations, you made it this far. I should have really packed this
        with far more SEO-loaded content, but I'll be damned if I'm rewriting it
        now. If you're after a front end developer in the Leeds, UK or Whistler,
        BC, Canada area feel free to get in touch.
